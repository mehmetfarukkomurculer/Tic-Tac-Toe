## Overview

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, and the first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

## Features

- Two players can play the game.
- The game displays the current state of the board after each move.
- The game checks for a winner after each move.
- The game ends when one player wins or when the board is full, resulting in a draw.
